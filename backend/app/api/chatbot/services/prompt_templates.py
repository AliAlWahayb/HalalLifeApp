E470-E483 (Various emulsifiers) - May be derived from animal fats
E542 (Edible bone phosphate) - Derived from animal bones
E631, E627 (Disodium inosinate, Disodium guanylate) - May be derived from meat
E904 (Shellac) - From insect secretions, questionable halal status

TYPICALLY HARAM E-CODES:
E441 (Gelatin) - Usually from pork or non-halal slaughtered animals
E542 (Bone phosphate) - Typically from non-halal animal sources
E920 (L-cysteine) - Often extracted from human hair or duck feathers, requires halal certification
"""

# Template for analyzing products
PRODUCT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
When analyzing products for halal status, consider:

1. INGREDIENT ASSESSMENT:
   - Check each ingredient against known halal/haram substances
   - Pay special attention to additives, particularly E-numbers
   - Look for animal-derived ingredients that may be problematic

2. CERTIFICATION EVALUATION:
   - Look for recognized halal certification symbols
   - Consider the reputation and standards of the certifying body
   - Note that certification provides greater assurance than ingredient analysis alone

3. CROSS-CONTAMINATION RISK:
   - Products manufactured on shared equipment with pork or alcohol may be problematic
   - Some Muslims avoid products with even trace contamination
   - Others follow the principle that traces below a certain threshold are acceptable

When uncertain, acknowledge the limitations and suggest seeking certified products instead.
"""

# Template for ingredient queries
INGREDIENT_QUERY_TEMPLATE = """
When answering a question about a specific ingredient's halal status:

1. SOURCE IDENTIFICATION:
   - Identify the typical or possible sources of the ingredient
   - Explain if it can be derived from multiple sources (animal vs. plant)
   - Be specific about which animal sources are problematic (pork vs. beef)

2. HALAL STATUS EXPLANATION:
   - Clearly state if it's generally halal, haram, or conditionally acceptable
   - Explain any conditions that affect its status (e.g., source, processing)
   - Note any differences of opinion among Islamic scholars when relevant

3. PRACTICAL ADVICE:
   - Suggest how to verify the source (e.g., certifications, contacting manufacturers)
   - Mention alternatives if the ingredient is problematic
   - Provide context about how commonly it appears in food products

Your goal is to provide the most accurate information while acknowledging any uncertainties.
