Saponin is a glucoside which will yield quillaic acid and quillaia-sapotoxin upon decomposure. The latter products are both poisonous irritants, however it is the sapotoxin which foams upon shaking. Quillaic acid is also known as 3, 16-dihydroxy-23-oxo-12-oleanen-28-oic acid. Used in the production of foam on non-alcoholic beverages. Use is banned in a number of countries. Used medically as a stimulating expectorant."
340,E1103,Invertase,Stabiliser,1,"An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose. Also called saccharase, sucrase. Traditionally, invertase was produced on site by autolysing yeast cells. The autolysate was added to the syrup (70% sucrose (w/w) ) to be inverted together with small amounts of xylene to prevent microbial growth. Inversion was complete in 48 -72 hours at 50?C and pH 4. 5. The enzyme and xylene were removed during the subsequent refining and evaporation. Partially inverted syrups were (and still are) produced by blending totally inverted syrups with sucrose syrups. Now, commercially produced invertase concentrates are employed. Invertase is also used in the production of confectionery with liquid or soft centres. GeneticallyModifiedEnzymes In many cases the enzymes named below are brand names. They may appear under other names as well. Enzymes are usually found in minuscule quantities in the final food product. The toxin found in genetically engineered tryptophan was less than 0. 1 percent of the total weight of the product, yet it was enough to kill people. The use of enzymes is pervasive in the food industry. Nothing is known about the long term effects of genetically engineered enzymes.
